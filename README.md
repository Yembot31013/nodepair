# Web3 Freelance Website

Welcome to the Web3 Freelance Website repository! This project is a decentralized freelancing platform that aims to provide a secure and transparent environment for freelancers and clients to collaborate. While we are still in the early stages of development, our goal is to leverage blockchain technology to enhance trust and enable direct transactions between freelancers and clients.

## Project Overview

The Web3 Freelance Website is being built to disrupt the traditional freelancing industry by introducing decentralized and transparent features. Our platform aims to eliminate intermediaries and provide a direct connection between freelancers and clients. Although the decentralized aspects are still under development, we are focused on delivering a user-friendly and efficient freelancing experience.

## Key Features

- **User Registration and Profiles**: Freelancers and clients can create their accounts, set up profiles, and showcase their skills and services.

- **Job Listings**: Clients can post job listings, specifying project requirements, deadlines, and budget.

- **Bidding System**: Freelancers can browse job listings and submit proposals with their pricing and project timelines.

- **Communication Platform**: Our built-in messaging system allows freelancers and clients to communicate and discuss project details.

- **Project Tracking**: Clients can track the progress of their projects, view submitted deliverables, and provide feedback.

- **Rating and Review System**: Users can leave ratings and reviews for completed projects, building credibility within the platform.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Web3 Freelance Website, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/web3-freelance-website.git
    cd web3-freelance-website
    ```
 
2. Set up a virtual environment && Install the required dependencies:

    To set up a virtual environment for your project, follow these steps:

    1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

    2. Navigate to the root folder of your project.

    3. Install `virtualenv` if you haven't already. Run the following command:

        ```
        pip install virtualenv
        ```

    4. Create a new virtual environment. Run the following command:

        - For Windows:

            ```
            virtualenv venv
            ```

        - For macOS and Linux:

            ```
            python3 -m venv venv
            ```

    This command creates a new directory named `venv` (you can choose a different name if you prefer) that will contain the virtual environment files.

    5. Activate the virtual environment:

        - For Windows:

            ```
            venv\Scripts\activate
            ```

        - For macOS and Linux:

            ```
            source venv/bin/activate
            ```

    After activation, you will see `(venv)` in your command prompt, indicating that you are now working within the virtual environment.

    6. Install the project dependencies into the virtual environment using `pip`. Run the following command:

        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ``` 

3. Run the development server:
    ```console
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

4. Access the website in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
